### Introduction

Around 2011, a year before finishing high school I begun to seriously think about what I am going to do next and decided that I should give myself a challenge and go abroad. The country I went to and stayed there for a four years was Denmark, where I studied *Multimedia Design and Communication* in Aarhus, second largest city after Copenhagen, and *Marketing Management* in Horsens.

When studying Multimedia I've got a good introduction to many subjects, but in my opinion the key moment was when I asked myself - wait, of everyone in this class is going to study PHP, maybe I should pick some other language up? It was the question that made me curious and motivataded to read more in-depth about software engineering and communities around them. I decided to study Python because of its' community and versatility of Python itself. Only with Python I could try many different areas like web development, databases, data science, machine learning, data visualisation and many others.

I think that's even out of discussion. If you are or want to work with Web Development, you just have to learn JavaScript. Not ReactJS, Angular or any other framework (sure it's a plus), but plain JavaScript aka VanillaJS. 

### Content

So as you probably guesed, I am going to write about software development. *Mostly* I am going to focus on Front-End development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Back-End development with Python (Django Framework). That being said, I really don't want to limit myself, so from time to time I will make a post about what I learned about data analytics, data visualization and similar. I hope we are going to learn a lot.
